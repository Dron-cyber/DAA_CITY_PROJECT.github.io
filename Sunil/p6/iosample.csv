Problem Title,Garbage Truck Route Optimization (TSP Heuristics)
Problem Statement,Calculate the most efficient circular route for sanitation trucks to visit thousands of bins daily, minimizing fuel consumption and operational time.

Input,Number of bins: 4
Input,Distance from bin 0: 0 10 15 20
Input,Distance from bin 1: 10 0 35 25
Input,Distance from bin 2: 15 35 0 30
Input,Distance from bin 3: 20 25 30 0

Output,Optimized route (approximate): 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0
Output,Total distance: 80
